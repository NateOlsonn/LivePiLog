# LivePiLog
This repo supports a custom live logging software to display things like RPM, Load, AFR, and more. This project uses a Pi-0-W and an Arduino with analog input. Utilizing this repo on your own hardware requires understanding how to obtain data from your engines ECU, or specific sensors. You can piggyback off of your ecu pin-holes or do some splicing
